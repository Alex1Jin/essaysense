# About Datasets

This project uses the following datasets:

- [Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes/data): `datasets/training_set_rel3.tsv`
- [GloVe (6B tokens version)](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe): `datasets/glove.6B.50d.txt`
- [NLTK's](https://nltk.org) punctuation tokenizer metadata.

[GloVe](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) word representation resources are licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and pre-trained embeddings are licensed under the [Public Domain Dedication and License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/).

Due to the data size and copyright problems, we would not save the whole datasets in this repository. You need download them and put them into appropriate directories yourself.
