# About datasets

This project uses the following datasets:

- [Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes/data): `datasets/training_set_rel3.tsv`
- [GloVe (6B tokens version)](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe): `datasets/glove.6B.50d.txt`
- You must download nltk's 'punkt' model for tokenizing sentences.

Due to the data size and copyright problems, we would not save datasets in this repository. A downloader is provided. When running this application for the first time, these datasets will be automatically downloaded.
